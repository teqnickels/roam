# Roam
 A travel community, code-named Roam for now, for users to share tips about their favorite locations around the world.

__INSTRUCTIONS__
__NOTE:__ If you have a database entitled `roam` on your system, it will be deleted by this setup. 

- `npm run setup`
- Set up a `.env` file at the top level, following `.env.template`
- `npm run start` or `npm run start:dev`

## Description

You have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named Roam for now, for users to share tips about their favorite locations around the world.

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories (broken into sprints). In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

## Context

This goal will give you experience building an app from a set of client needs. The goal is to gain experience working on a development project in a group while navigating a client's feature list.

Choose this goal if youâ€™ve already build full-stack JavaScript apps or are interested in leveling-up your skills. Roam requires that you implement authentication- not a trivial task! This will be an immersive, intensive, and highly structured study.

## Recommended Pace

The client contract consists of three core sprints and four bonus sprints. Each sprint contains a set of user stories.

You will work in a group of 2, and we expect you to pair program for the majority of the time you're writing code.

During morning standups and in smaller check-ins throughout the day, clearly communicate your current status and next steps to your teammates. Consider using a kanban-style scrum board such as GitHub Projects or Trello to organize tasks.

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Consider creating automated tests or even implementing TDD for any complex application behavior.

Put effort into your design. Use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap) and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

Work as git collaborators, build on feature branches, and submit pull requests for approval and merging.

After each sprint, deploy to heroku to get practice getting the app online. The earlier you resolve deployment, the easier it will be on each updated version.

Refactor your code after each sprint, considering:

Indentation
Readability/clarity
Naming
Organization
Commenting
DRYness
Wireframes
